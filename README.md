# What is SafeMoon üåö ?

SafeMoon Protocol is a mixture of `RFI tokenomics` with the added function of auto-liquidity generating protocol. A fork from `BEE` with some added benefits.

* First, the dev has minted the tokens ‚û°Ô∏è sent the balance to DxSale for fair launch ‚û°Ô∏è then burned the remainder of the tokens. Dev had to partake in presale.
* Second, utilized the DxSale protocol to foster trust in the community by auto-locking liquidity for **4 years**.
Simple tokenomics, elegant design and the production of token information has catered to the overall success of the project.
* **‚úîÔ∏è 100% community owned and driven - no rug is possible.**
